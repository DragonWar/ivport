IVPORT
======

Raspberry Pi Camera Module Multiplexer by [Ivmech Mechatronics](http://www.ivmech.com)

IVPORT which is the first Raspberry Pi (also Raspberry Pi A,A+,B+ and Raspberry Pi 2 fully compatible) Camera Module multiplexer is designed to make possible connecting more than one camera module to single CSI camera port on Raspberry Pi. Multiplexing can be controlled by 3 pins for 4 camera modules, 5 pins for 8 camera modules and 9 pins for **maximum up to 16 camera modules** with using GPIO.

### Updated Notes

The closest approach to **simultaneous capturing** at **640x480 resolution with 7 fps** each camera connected to Ivport Camera Multiplexer (4 camera boards were connected.) by utilizing Raspberry Pi's video-capture capabilities with a JPEG encoder. See more details [here](https://github.com/ivmech/ivport/wiki/Capture-Sequence).
