IVPORT
======

Raspberry Pi Camera Module Multiplexer

### See documentation [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivmech/ivport/master/docs/ivport_manual.pdf).pdf

IVPORT which is the first Raspberry Pi (also Raspberry Pi B+ and ODROID-W compatible) Camera Module multiplexer is designed to make possible connecting more than one camera module to Raspberry Pi.  Multiplexing can be controlled by 3pins for 4 camera modules, 5 pins for 8 camera modules and 9 pins for 16 camera modules with using GPIO.

After headers and jumpers are soldered, Camera Module can be attached to Ivport with using its flexible flat cable to preferred connector. Also one more flexible flat cable (same as Camera Module's) needed for connection between “Raspberry Pi Camera Input” and “Ivport Input”. After flexible flat cable connection, Ivport can be attached to Raspberry Pi's GPIO headers.
